# DBMigrate

## What is it?

This is a plugin for the ColdFusion on Wheels framework that provides support for database migrations.  Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner.  This plugin tracks which migrations have already been run so all you have to do is update the database by clicking a button!  Also these migrations are database independent

## Versioning
I will be maintaining this application using the following release numbering format:
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
And constructed with the following guidelines:
* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

## Requirements
ColdFusion on Wheels framework 1.1.3+
I have tested this plugin on the following CFML Engines:

* Adobe ColdFusion 9.0 Standard
* Adobe ColdFusion 9.0 Enterprise
* Railo 3.2.3+

## Installation
Once you have one a CFML engine correctly configured and operating on your system, you can place this plugin into your /plugins directory that's found in the root of your ColdFusion on Wheels application.  Reload your application using the Reload link in the footer and you'll now see a "dbmigrate" link for you to use the plugin.
